# ScrabbleDuelSolver
Terribly Written Scrabble Duel Solver for the Scrabble Go App


This is an incomplete side project to autmatically play Scrabble go Duels using python and ADB. Note that the automatic placing of tiles relies on ADB but the solver will still calculate the best play it can which can be manually inputed if need be. 

The layout of the bonus tiles is something which can automatically be read using ADB or generated manually.
